# Creating forms

When creating UI for forms, we typically solve two separate tasks:

* We position the form components on the screen and we try to make the form pleasant for the eye and easy to use
* We populate the components with data, visualise the values, validate the values and then gather the values into a
  single bean when the user presses the "Save" button.

## Positioning form components

We typically use `FormLayout` to position fields such as `TextField` in a form. Please see below on
the example of a very simple form:
