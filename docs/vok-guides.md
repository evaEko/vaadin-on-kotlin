# Vaadin-on-Kotlin Guides for Vaadin 8

Vaadin 8 is stable and battle-proven framework. Start here if you need to be production-ready.

## Getting started Guides

When you are not familiar with Vaadin-on-Kotlin (or VoK for short), start here:

* The [Getting Started](gettingstarted.md) guide

## Building the UIs

* [Creating UIs](creating_ui.md) explains how to compose your UI out of visual components such as Buttons and TextFields
* [Creating Forms](forms.md) walks you through the forms - how to create UI for them and how to validate the data.
* [Navigating](navigating.md) allows you to create multiple pages and explains how to navigate between them
* [Using Grids](grids.md) shows best practices on how to display a lazy-loaded tabular list of data.

## Database access guides

Continue reading here to understand how exactly VoK accesses the database.

* The [Accessing Databases Guide](databases.md) for accessing SQL databases
* The [Accessing NoSQL or REST data sources](nosql_rest_datasources.md) for displaying data
  from a NoSQL database, or a REST service endpoint.
* [Writing services](services.md) to place your business logic in

## Security

Security is an important part of any web-based application. Please check the following resources for more information:

* The [vok-security](https://github.com/mvysny/vaadin-on-kotlin/blob/master/vok-security/README.md) module description.

## Testing

* The [Browserless Testing Guide](https://github.com/mvysny/karibu-testing)

# Vaadin-on-Kotlin Guides for Vaadin 10

Vaadin 10 is based on Web Components as opposed to Vaadin 8 (which is based
on a GWT-based customized widget system). The programming model
tends to differ a bit from Vaadin 8, and that's why there is a separate set of guides
for Vaadin 8 and for Vaadin 10. Don't worry though - Vaadin 10 still uses the
component-oriented approach we love from Vaadin 8.
